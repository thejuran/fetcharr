# Fetcharr

## What This Is

A lightweight Docker-based tool that automates searches in Radarr and Sonarr for wanted and cutoff unmet items. Configurable round-robin searches at configurable intervals with a dark theme web UI featuring dashboard observability (position progress, outcome badges, live log viewer), browsable search history with filtering/pagination, and config editing. Includes CI/CD pipeline, automated GHCR publishing, SQLite search history, and comprehensive documentation. Built with Python/FastAPI and htmx/Jinja2. Zero credential exposure by design.

## Core Value

Reliably trigger searches in Radarr and Sonarr for missing and upgrade-eligible media on a schedule, without exposing credentials or expanding attack surface.

### Active

(None — define in next milestone)

### Out of Scope

- User accounts / authentication — local network tool, no auth needed
- Lidarr / Readarr / other *arr support — Radarr + Sonarr only
- Multi-instance support — single Radarr + single Sonarr
- Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Apprise) — web UI log sufficient
- Prowlarr / indexer management — uses existing *arr search infrastructure
- Download queue management — *arr apps handle this
- Media discovery / TMDB browsing — Overseerr's job
- OAuth / SSO — no accounts means no auth flows
- Mobile app — web UI sufficient

## Context

Shipped v1.2 with ~5,225 Python LOC. 174 tests passing.
Tech stack: Python 3.13, FastAPI, httpx, Pydantic, APScheduler, aiosqlite, Jinja2, htmx, Tailwind CSS v4, loguru, ruff.
Docker: multi-stage build with pytailwindcss builder, python:3.13-slim production, PUID/PGID entrypoint.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions (pytest, ruff, Docker build validation) with uv caching + GHCR release workflow with BuildKit cache.
Registry: ghcr.io/thejuran/fetcharr

Replaces Huntarr's core search functionality without the security liabilities (plaintext passwords, unauthenticated API key exposure, 2FA bypass). Deliberately minimal attack surface.

Known tech debt (from v1.2 deep code review, deferred to next milestone):
- No rate limiting on search-now endpoint
- No CSRF protection on settings POST
- Unbounded search history table growth
- No connection pooling for aiosqlite
- No health check endpoint or graceful shutdown handler
- No request timeout on outbound HTTP calls
- Hardcoded pageSize defaults not configurable

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Python (FastAPI) + htmx/Jinja2 — matches user's existing project experience
- **Deployment**: Docker container with docker-compose support
- **Security**: API keys must never be exposed via any HTTP endpoint
- **Scope**: Search automation only — deliberately minimal to reduce attack surface

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Python/FastAPI over Go | User familiarity, faster iteration | ✓ Good — built in 2 days |
| htmx/Jinja2 over React SPA | Lightweight, no build step, server-rendered | ✓ Good — simple, fast |
| Season-level Sonarr search | Avoids hammering indexers with full-show searches | ✓ Good |
| Round-robin over random | Ensures every item gets searched eventually | ✓ Good |
| No auth | No user accounts = no passwords to store | ✓ Good — core security decision |
| Single instance per app | Simpler config, matches user's setup | ✓ Good |
| APScheduler 3.x over 4.x | 4.x still alpha, 3.x stable with AsyncIOScheduler | ✓ Good |
| JSON state over SQLite | Simpler for cursor + bounded log | ✓ Good — schema migration added in v1.0 |
| Origin/Referer CSRF over tokens | No auth/sessions means no cookies to protect | ✓ Good |
| Vendored htmx over CDN | Reproducible builds, no external dependency | ✓ Good |
| Custom loguru sink for redaction | Filter only sees message, sink sees full output including tracebacks | ✓ Good |
| Ruff rule sets E,F,I,UP,B,SIM | Comprehensive but non-noisy linting | ✓ Good — caught 32 violations at adoption |
| Three parallel CI jobs | No inter-job deps for fastest feedback | ✓ Good |
| docker/metadata-action for tags | Avoids manual shell scripting for GHCR tags | ✓ Good |
| BuildKit GHA cache | Faster Docker rebuilds in CI | ✓ Good |
| Proportional hard max split | floor(missing/total*max) for missing, remainder for cutoff | ✓ Good |
| Connection-per-op SQLite | aiosqlite context manager per function call | ✓ Good |
| Auto-prune at 500 rows | DELETE after each insert keeps DB bounded | ✓ Good |
| Docker Compose only install | No docker run or bare-metal instructions | ✓ Good — simplest path |
| uv cache + BuildKit GHA cache in CI | Faster remote CI runs without adding complexity | ✓ Good |
| Sonarr version detection reuses validate_connection endpoint | No extra network call for version check | ✓ Good |
| Failed searches recorded to DB | Enables outcome tracking and history filtering | ✓ Good |
| Closure-based redacting buffer sink | Secrets redacted before buffer storage, secret list stays in logging.py | ✓ Good |
| Toggle-pill filter pattern for history | URL param manipulation in Jinja2, no JS framework needed | ✓ Good |
| hx-vals tojson for XSS prevention | Double-quoted tojson filter prevents single-quote breakout | ✓ Good |
| Atomic config write (tempfile + fsync + os.replace) | Matches state.py pattern, prevents partial writes | ✓ Good |
| Episode fallback dropped (SRCH-17) | Sonarr SeasonSearch natively handles both season packs and episodes | ✓ Good — avoided unnecessary complexity |
