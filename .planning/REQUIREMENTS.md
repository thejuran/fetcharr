# Requirements: Fetcharr

**Defined:** 2026-02-24
**Core Value:** Reliably trigger searches in Radarr and Sonarr for missing and upgrade-eligible media on a schedule, without exposing credentials or expanding attack surface.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for Ship & Document release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Documentation

- [ ] **DOCS-01**: README has install instructions (Docker pull + docker-compose example)
- [ ] **DOCS-02**: README documents all config options (TOML fields, defaults, valid ranges)
- [ ] **DOCS-03**: README explains security model (what's protected, what's not, why no auth)
- [ ] **DOCS-04**: README includes screenshots of dashboard and config editor

### CI/CD

- [x] **CICD-01**: GitHub Actions runs pytest on every PR and push to main
- [x] **CICD-02**: GitHub Actions runs linting (ruff) on every PR and push to main
- [x] **CICD-03**: GitHub Actions validates Docker build on every PR

### Release Pipeline

- [x] **RELS-01**: Push to main builds and pushes ghcr.io/thejuran/fetcharr:dev
- [x] **RELS-02**: Git tag push builds and pushes ghcr.io/thejuran/fetcharr:latest + version tag
- [x] **RELS-03**: CLAUDE.md documents deep code review convention (offer /deep-review before push)

### Search Features

- [ ] **SRCH-12**: User can set a hard max items per cycle that overrides per-app counts
- [ ] **SRCH-13**: Search history persisted to SQLite (survives container restart, queryable)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Search

- **SRCH-14**: Search history UI with filtering and pagination (beyond current bounded log)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts / authentication | No auth = no passwords = no credential attack surface |
| Lidarr / Readarr / other *arr support | Radarr + Sonarr cover the primary use case |
| Multi-instance support | Single Radarr + single Sonarr matches user's setup |
| Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Apprise) | Web UI log sufficient |
| Prowlarr integration / indexer stats | Out of search automation scope |
| Docker Hub | Using ghcr.io for consistency with other projects |
| Automated changelog generation | Manual release notes sufficient for now |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| DOCS-01 | Phase 12 | Pending |
| DOCS-02 | Phase 12 | Pending |
| DOCS-03 | Phase 12 | Pending |
