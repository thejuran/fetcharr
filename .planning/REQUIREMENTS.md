# Requirements: Fetcharr

**Defined:** 2026-02-23
**Core Value:** Reliably trigger searches in Radarr and Sonarr for missing and upgrade-eligible media on a schedule, without exposing credentials or expanding attack surface.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Connections

- [x] **CONN-01**: User can configure Radarr connection via URL + API key, validated on startup
- [x] **CONN-02**: User can configure Sonarr connection via URL + API key, validated on startup

### Search Engine

- [x] **SRCH-01**: Fetcharr fetches wanted (missing) items from Radarr
- [x] **SRCH-02**: Fetcharr fetches cutoff unmet items from Radarr
- [x] **SRCH-03**: Fetcharr fetches wanted (missing) items from Sonarr
- [x] **SRCH-04**: Fetcharr fetches cutoff unmet items from Sonarr
- [x] **SRCH-05**: Fetcharr cycles through items sequentially via round-robin, wrapping to start
- [x] **SRCH-06**: Sonarr searches trigger at season level using SeasonSearch command
- [x] **SRCH-07**: Missing and cutoff queues are separate per app with independent cursors
- [x] **SRCH-08**: Round-robin cursor positions persist across container restarts
- [x] **SRCH-09**: Unmonitored items are filtered out before adding to search queue
- [x] **SRCH-10**: Future air date items are filtered out of Sonarr queues
- [x] **SRCH-11**: Search log entries show human-readable item names, not just IDs

### Configuration

- [x] **CONF-01**: User can configure number of items to search per cycle, per app (separate missing/cutoff counts)
- [x] **CONF-02**: User can configure search interval per app

### Web UI

- [x] **WEBU-01**: Dashboard shows last run time and next scheduled run per app
- [x] **WEBU-02**: Dashboard shows recent search history with item names and timestamps
- [x] **WEBU-03**: Dashboard shows current round-robin queue position per app
- [x] **WEBU-04**: Dashboard shows wanted and cutoff unmet item counts per app
- [x] **WEBU-05**: User can edit all settings via web UI config editor without file editing
- [x] **WEBU-06**: Dashboard shows connection status with "unreachable since" when *arr is down
- [x] **WEBU-07**: User can enable/disable each app via toggle without changing other config
- [x] **WEBU-08**: User can trigger an immediate search cycle per app via "search now" button

### Security

- [x] **SECR-01**: API keys are stored server-side only and never returned by any HTTP endpoint
- [x] **SECR-02**: State-changing POST endpoints reject cross-origin requests via Origin/Referer validation
- [x] **SECR-03**: ArrConfig URL validates scheme (http/https) and blocks cloud metadata endpoints
- [x] **SECR-04**: All form integer fields are bounds-checked and never crash on invalid input
- [x] **SECR-05**: Docker container drops all capabilities, binds to localhost, and sets no-new-privileges
- [x] **SECR-06**: Config file written with restrictive permissions (0o600)
- [x] **SECR-07**: htmx bundled locally — no external CDN dependency

### Quality & Resilience

- [x] **QUAL-01**: Concurrent search cycles serialized via asyncio.Lock — no state race condition
- [x] **QUAL-02**: Settings validated before writing to disk — invalid config never corrupts TOML file
- [x] **QUAL-03**: Atomic state writes clean up temp files on failure; corrupt state recovers to defaults
- [x] **QUAL-04**: State file load fills missing keys from defaults for forward-compatible schema migration
- [x] **QUAL-05**: Log redaction covers exception tracebacks; settings hot-reload refreshes redaction filter
- [x] **QUAL-06**: All API response parsing handles ValidationError gracefully; httpx retry covers RemoteProtocolError
- [x] **QUAL-07**: All async code paths (clients, cycles, scheduler, startup) have test coverage

### Deployment

- [x] **DEPL-01**: Fetcharr runs as a Docker container with docker-compose support

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Extended Search

- **SRCH-12**: Configurable hard limit / safety ceiling on max items per cycle
- **SRCH-13**: Persistent search history beyond in-memory log (SQLite storage)

### Documentation

- **DOCS-01**: README documents explicit security model (what is/isn't returned by endpoints)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts / authentication | No auth = no passwords to store = no credential attack surface. Run on Tailscale or behind VPN. |
| Lidarr / Readarr / other *arr support | Radarr + Sonarr cover the primary use case. Each new app adds API complexity. |
| Multi-instance support | Single Radarr + single Sonarr matches user's setup. Run two containers if needed. |
| Notifications (Discord, Telegram, Apprise) | Web UI log is sufficient. Adds dependency and config surface area. |
| Prowlarr integration / indexer stats | Indexer management is out of scope. Use Prowlarr's own UI. |
| Download queue management | *arr apps manage their own queues. Out of search automation scope. |
| Stalled download detection (Swaparr) | Completely outside search automation scope. Use decluttarr. |
| Media discovery / TMDB browsing | This is Overseerr's job, not a search tool's. |
| Storage monitoring | *arr apps refuse imports when disk is full. Edge case optimization. |
| RSS feed monitoring | *arr apps already do RSS sync natively. This tool fills the backlog. |
| OAuth / SSO | No accounts means no auth flows needed. |
