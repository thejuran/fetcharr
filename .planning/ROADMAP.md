# Roadmap: Fetcharr

## Overview

Fetcharr is a single-process automation daemon that cycles through Radarr and Sonarr's wanted/cutoff-unmet lists on a configurable schedule. Security invariants (no API key in any HTTP response) are established from day one and never relaxed.

## Milestones

### v1.2 Polish & Harden

**Milestone Goal:** Harden search resilience, improve dashboard observability, and ship CI to GitHub.

- [x] **Phase 13: CI & Search Diagnostics** - Push CI to GitHub and add backend search diagnostic logging (completed 2026-02-24)
- [x] **Phase 14: Dashboard Observability** - Enhance dashboard with position progress, app logs, and search detail (completed 2026-02-24)
- [ ] **Phase 15: Search History UI** - Browsable search history with filtering and pagination
- [ ] **Phase 16: Sonarr Episode Fallback** - Automatic episode-level retry when season search fails

## Phase Details

### Phase 13: CI & Search Diagnostics
**Goal**: CI runs on GitHub remote runners and search cycles produce diagnostic logs for troubleshooting
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: CICD-04, SRCH-15, SRCH-16
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. CI workflow runs on GitHub Actions and all tests pass on remote runners
  2. Fetcharr logs the detected Sonarr API version (v3 or v4) at startup
  3. Each search cycle logs the total item count fetched so users can detect pageSize truncation in large libraries
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md -- CI workflow hardening with caching for remote runners
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md -- Sonarr API version detection and per-cycle diagnostic logging

### Phase 14: Dashboard Observability
**Goal**: Users can see detailed search progress, outcomes, and application logs directly in the web dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: WEBU-09, WEBU-10, WEBU-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dashboard position labels display "X of Y" format (e.g., "3 of 47") instead of bare cursor numbers
  2. A dedicated section in the dashboard shows recent application log messages from loguru
  3. Search log entries display outcome/detail information (e.g., search triggered, error encountered) alongside item name and timestamp
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md -- Position labels ("X of Y") and search log outcome/detail
- [ ] 14-02-PLAN.md -- Application log viewer section with loguru ring buffer

### Phase 15: Search History UI
**Goal**: Users can browse and filter their complete search history beyond the dashboard's recent log
**Depends on**: Phase 14
**Requirements**: SRCH-14
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can navigate to a search history page from the dashboard
  2. User can filter search history by app (Radarr/Sonarr) and queue type (missing/cutoff)
  3. Search history displays with pagination so large histories remain navigable
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 15-01: TBD

### Phase 16: Sonarr Episode Fallback
**Goal**: Sonarr searches recover automatically when season-level search fails by retrying at episode granularity
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: SRCH-17
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When a Sonarr SeasonSearch command fails or returns an error, Fetcharr automatically retries with individual EpisodeSearch commands for that season's episodes
  2. Episode fallback events are logged so users can see when and why fallback was triggered
  3. The fallback does not re-search episodes that are already downloaded
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 16-01: TBD
