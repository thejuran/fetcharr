# Roadmap: Fetcharr

## Overview

Fetcharr is a single-process automation daemon that cycles through Radarr and Sonarr's wanted/cutoff-unmet lists on a configurable schedule. The build order is dictated by the dependency graph: foundation infrastructure must be correct before the search engine is built on top of it, the web UI reads state produced by the search engine, and Docker packages a working application last. Security invariants (no API key in any HTTP response) are established in Phase 1 and never relaxed.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Config, state, and API clients with security invariants established
- [x] **Phase 2: Search Engine** - Scheduler, round-robin, and cycle logic — the core product
- [x] **Phase 3: Web UI** - Status dashboard and config editor backed by real state data
- [x] **Phase 4: Docker** - Multi-stage packaging and release-ready artifact
- [ ] **Phase 5: Security Hardening** - CSRF, SSRF, input validation, Docker hardening, and CDN removal
- [ ] **Phase 6: Bug Fixes & Resilience** - Race conditions, error handling, state recovery, and log redaction
- [ ] **Phase 7: Test Coverage** - Async path tests for clients, cycles, scheduler, and startup

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: Fetcharr can connect to Radarr and Sonarr, validate those connections on startup, fetch paginated wanted/cutoff-unmet lists, and do so without ever exposing an API key in any HTTP response
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CONN-01, CONN-02, SECR-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Fetcharr starts up, validates Radarr and Sonarr connections, and logs success or a clear error message if either is unreachable
  2. Fetcharr can fetch the full paginated wanted (missing) and cutoff-unmet item lists from both Radarr and Sonarr
  3. No HTTP endpoint — including any config or status endpoint — returns an API key value in its response body or headers
  4. All *arr API calls use X-Api-Key header auth; no API key ever appears in a URL or log line
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Project scaffolding, config models (Pydantic + TOML), logging with redaction, and atomic JSON state store
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — httpx API clients (base + Radarr + Sonarr) with paginated list fetching and retry logic
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Startup orchestration (entry point, validation, banner) and test suite

### Phase 2: Search Engine
**Goal**: Fetcharr automatically cycles through wanted and cutoff-unmet items for both apps on a configurable schedule, with round-robin position persisted across restarts and Sonarr searching at season level
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SRCH-01, SRCH-02, SRCH-03, SRCH-04, SRCH-05, SRCH-06, SRCH-07, SRCH-08, SRCH-09, SRCH-10, SRCH-11, CONF-01, CONF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Fetcharr triggers MoviesSearch commands for Radarr wanted and cutoff-unmet items on a configurable interval, cycling sequentially through the list
  2. Fetcharr triggers SeasonSearch commands for Sonarr at season level (not series or episode level), deduplicating episode records to unique (seriesId, seasonNumber) pairs before searching
  3. Missing and cutoff-unmet queues are independent with separate cursors per app; advancing one does not affect the other
  4. Round-robin cursor positions survive a container restart — position is read from the state file on startup, not reset to zero
  5. Unmonitored items and future air date items (Sonarr) are filtered out before being added to any search queue
  6. Search log entries record human-readable item names alongside timestamps, not just internal IDs
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Config extension (search tuning fields), client search methods, and core engine utilities (filtering, batch slicing, search logging)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Radarr and Sonarr search cycle functions with round-robin cursors, episode-to-season deduplication, and skip-on-failure error handling
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — APScheduler integration via FastAPI lifespan, uvicorn entry point, state persistence per cycle, and search engine test suite

### Phase 3: Web UI
**Goal**: Users can view the current automation status, recent search history, and queue positions in a browser, and can edit all settings without touching config files
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: WEBU-01, WEBU-02, WEBU-03, WEBU-04, WEBU-05, WEBU-06, WEBU-07, WEBU-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The dashboard shows last run time, next scheduled run, current round-robin queue position, and wanted/cutoff-unmet item counts for each app without requiring a page reload (htmx polling)
  2. The dashboard shows recent search history with human-readable item names and timestamps
  3. When Radarr or Sonarr is unreachable, the dashboard shows "unreachable since [time]" rather than silently failing or showing stale data
  4. User can view and edit all settings (URLs, intervals, batch sizes, per-app enable/disable) via a web form and save without editing any file on disk
  5. User can trigger an immediate search cycle for a specific app via a "search now" button in the UI
  6. The config editor never displays API key values — placeholders are shown instead, and keys are only accepted on write
**Plans**: 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — FastAPI routes and Jinja2 base templates, htmx polling for status dashboard
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Dashboard panels (last run, next run, queue position, item counts, connection status, search log)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Config editor form (GET with masked keys, POST with PRG pattern, per-app enable/disable toggle, search-now trigger)

### Phase 4: Docker
**Goal**: Fetcharr runs as a Docker container that any self-hoster can pull and run with docker-compose, with config and state on a volume and no credentials baked into the image
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: DEPL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docker compose up` starts Fetcharr and the web UI is reachable in a browser
  2. Config and state files live on a named Docker volume and survive container recreation
  3. No API keys or config values are baked into the Docker image layers — all credentials are runtime-only via the volume-mounted config file
  4. Startup emits a clear error (not a silent hang) if the *arr URLs are configured as localhost (a common Docker networking mistake)
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Multi-stage Dockerfile (pytailwindcss builder + slim production), docker-compose.yml, PUID/PGID entrypoint, HEALTHCHECK, and localhost URL detection

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Foundation | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-23 |
| 2. Search Engine | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-24 |
| 3. Web UI | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-24 |

| 5. Security Hardening | 1/2 | In Progress | — |
| 6. Bug Fixes & Resilience | 0/? | Not Started | — |
| 7. Test Coverage | 0/? | Not Started | — |

### Phase 5: Security Hardening
**Goal**: All web-facing endpoints are protected against cross-origin attacks and input abuse, Docker defaults follow least-privilege, and no external CDN dependency remains
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: SECR-02, SECR-03, SECR-04, SECR-05, SECR-06, SECR-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All state-changing POST endpoints (`/settings`, `/api/search-now/{app}`) reject cross-origin requests via Origin/Referer header validation
  2. ArrConfig URL field validates scheme (http/https only) and blocks known cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254)
  3. Integer form fields (search_interval, search_missing_count, search_cutoff_count) are clamped to safe bounds and never crash on non-integer input
  4. log_level accepts only an explicit allowlist (debug, info, warning, error) — anything else defaults to info
  5. docker-compose.yml binds port to 127.0.0.1 only, container drops all capabilities, and entrypoint sets no-new-privileges
  6. Config TOML file is written with 0o600 permissions (owner read/write only)
  7. htmx is bundled as a local static file — no external CDN or unpinned script tag
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Origin/Referer CSRF middleware, Docker least-privilege hardening, htmx vendoring
- [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md — URL scheme + SSRF validation, integer clamping, log level allowlist, config file permissions

### Phase 6: Bug Fixes & Resilience
**Goal**: All critical and warning-level bugs from the code review are fixed — race conditions eliminated, error handling consistent, state recovery graceful, and log redaction comprehensive
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-03, QUAL-04, QUAL-05, QUAL-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Concurrent search cycles (scheduler + manual search-now) are serialized via asyncio.Lock — no state corruption possible
  2. Settings are validated via Pydantic model BEFORE writing to disk — invalid config never reaches the TOML file
  3. Temp files from atomic state writes are cleaned up on `os.replace` failure; corrupt state JSON recovers to defaults instead of crashing
  4. State file load fills missing keys from defaults (schema migration) so older state files do not crash newer code
  5. Log redaction covers exception tracebacks, and settings hot-reload re-initializes the redaction filter with new API keys
  6. `validate_connection` and `get_paginated` catch `ValidationError` gracefully; `RemoteProtocolError` is retried; `deduplicate_to_seasons` handles missing fields; httpx exception hierarchy is correct
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 6 to break down)

### Phase 7: Test Coverage
**Goal**: All async code paths have test coverage — the scheduler→engine→client chain, cycle functions, startup orchestration, and error/retry paths are exercised by the test suite
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: QUAL-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `_request_with_retry` has tests for first-attempt success, retry on failure, and re-raise when retry also fails
  2. `get_paginated` has tests for single page, multi-page, empty results, and malformed API response
  3. `validate_connection` has tests for success, 401, ConnectError, and TimeoutException branches
  4. `run_radarr_cycle` and `run_sonarr_cycle` have tests for happy path, network failure, per-item skip-on-failure, and cursor advancement
  5. `make_search_job` has tests for client-is-None early return and exception swallowing
  6. `collect_secrets` has a test verifying all configured API keys are extracted for redaction
**Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 7 to break down)
