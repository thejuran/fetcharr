<objective>
Create the project README.md with complete documentation covering installation, configuration, security model, and screenshots — enabling a new user to install and configure Fetcharr from the README alone.

Purpose: This is the final phase of v1.1 Ship & Document. The README is the primary onboarding document for new users discovering Fetcharr.
Output: README.md at project root, docs/screenshots/ directory with .gitkeep for screenshot placeholders.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md at the project root following the locked section order from CONTEXT.md. Reference the actual codebase for accuracy.

**Hero section:**
- One-liner: "Python automation daemon that triggers searches in Radarr and Sonarr on a schedule."
- Badge bar: CI status badge (GitHub Actions), Docker image badge (ghcr.io), license badge (choose appropriate — project has no LICENSE file yet, use a placeholder or skip license badge). Use shields.io badges.
- Brief motivation paragraph: "Radarr and Sonarr don't auto-search on a schedule. Fetcharr does." Then move on quickly.

**Table of Contents:**
- Linked section anchors to all major sections below.

**Features list (5-6 bullets):**
- Scheduled searches for missing and upgrade-eligible media
- Web dashboard with real-time status and search history
- Browser-based config editor (no manual TOML editing needed)
- Hard max limit to cap searches per cycle
- Persistent SQLite search history (survives restarts)
- Docker-first with PUID/PGID support

**Screenshots section:**
- Two image references with placeholder paths:
  - `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png` — caption: "Dashboard showing connection status, item counts, and search history"
  - `docs/screenshots/config-editor.png` — caption: "Config editor with inline validation"
- Add a note: "Screenshots show the dark-themed web UI running on port 8080."

**Install section (DOCS-01):**
- Docker Compose only (NO docker run one-liner, NO bare-metal instructions — per locked decision).
- Single copy-paste docker-compose.yml block with inline comments. Base this on the actual docker-compose.yml in the repo but ensure it's a clean, user-ready example. Include:
  - `ghcr.io/thejuran/fetcharr:latest` image
  - PUID/PGID environment variables with comments
  - Named volume at /config
  - Port mapping 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 with comment about Tailscale/reverse proxy
  - Security hardening (cap_drop, cap_add, no-new-privileges)
  - restart: unless-stopped
- After the compose block, explain: "Run `docker compose up -d`, then visit http://localhost:8080 to configure your Radarr/Sonarr connection."
- Mention first-run behavior: config file is auto-generated at /config/fetcharr.toml, use the web UI to configure.

**Config reference section (DOCS-02):**
- Annotated TOML example showing ALL fields from fetcharr/config.py DEFAULT_CONFIG and fetcharr/models/config.py:
  - `[general]` section: `log_level` (default: "info", valid: debug/info/warning/error), `hard_max_per_cycle` (default: 0 = unlimited, valid: 0+)
  - `[radarr]` section: `url` (string, e.g. "http://radarr:7878"), `api_key` (string, from Radarr Settings > General), `enabled` (bool, default: false), `search_interval` (int, default: 30, minutes), `search_missing_count` (int, default: 5), `search_cutoff_count` (int, default: 5)
  - `[sonarr]` section: same fields as radarr with sonarr-specific URL example ("http://sonarr:8989")
- Show environment variable overrides inline: mention that pydantic-settings supports env vars but TOML is the primary config method.
- Note: "You can also edit all settings from the web UI at http://localhost:8080/settings — changes are written to the TOML file and take effect immediately without restart."

**Security model section (DOCS-03):**
- Explain the design: Fetcharr has no authentication because it is designed to run on a trusted local network (behind Tailscale, VPN, or localhost-only binding).
- What IS protected: API keys are never exposed in HTTP responses or HTML (SecretStr discipline), log output redacts all configured secrets, config file written with 0o600 permissions, Docker container drops all capabilities except CHOWN/SETUID/SETGID, CSRF protection via Origin header checking on POST requests, URL validation blocks SSRF (non-http schemes, public IPs where inappropriate).
- What is NOT protected: there is no login/authentication — anyone with network access to port 8080 can view the dashboard and edit config. This is intentional: no passwords = no credential attack surface.
- Recommendation: bind to localhost (127.0.0.1:8080:8080 as shown in docker-compose) and access via Tailscale or reverse proxy with auth.

**Development section:**
- Brief section for contributors:
  - `uv sync --extra dev` to install dependencies
  - `uv run pytest tests/ -x -q` to run tests
  - `uv run ruff check fetcharr/ tests/` to lint
  - `uv run tailwindcss -i fetcharr/static/css/input.css -o fetcharr/static/css/output.css --watch` for CSS development
  - `docker build -t fetcharr:local .` for local Docker build

**Tone:** Concise and practical. Short sentences. Code-first. Minimal prose. Written for arr power users who already run Docker.

  <files>docs/screenshots/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
Create the `docs/screenshots/` directory with a `.gitkeep` file so the directory is tracked by git. The actual screenshot images (dashboard.png, config-editor.png) will be added manually by the user after taking screenshots of the running application.

The .gitkeep file should be empty — it exists solely to preserve the directory in git.
