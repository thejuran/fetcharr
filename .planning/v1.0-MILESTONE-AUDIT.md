## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Gaps |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| 1. Foundation | PASSED | 12/12 truths, 4/4 criteria | None |
| 2. Search Engine | PASSED | 6/6 criteria | None |
| 3. Web UI | NOT STARTED | — | Phase not built |
| 4. Docker | NOT STARTED | — | Phase not built |

---

## Cross-Phase Integration (Completed Phases)

**Integration checker result:** All 16 completed requirements are fully wired across the phase boundary.

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 wiring | 13 key exports consumed correctly |
| Orphaned exports | 0 |
| Missing connections | 0 |
| E2E flows verified | 3/3 (startup, Radarr cycle, Sonarr cycle) |
| Broken flows | 0 |
| Unprotected routes | N/A (no HTTP routes in Phase 1-2) |

### E2E Flows Verified

1. **Startup & validation:** Entry point → config load → secret collection → loguru redaction → banner → connection validation → settings returned to scheduler
2. **Radarr search cycle:** State load → fetch wanted/cutoff → filter monitored → slice batch → MoviesSearch → log with title → advance cursor → persist state
3. **Sonarr search cycle:** Fetch episodes with series → filter unmonitored/future → deduplicate to seasons → SeasonSearch → log with "Show - Season N" → persist state

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 01-foundation | `fetcharr/__main__.py` lines 13, 25 — "placeholder" in docstring (intentional Phase 1 design note) | INFO |
| global | `tomli-w` listed in `pyproject.toml` but never imported — unused production dependency | LOW |

**Total:** 2 items across 2 categories (no blockers)

---

## Test Suite

| Phase | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1. Foundation | 21 | 21 passed |
| 2. Search Engine | 19 | 19 passed |
| **Total** | **40** | **40 passed** |

---

## Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements found in completed phases. All requirement IDs in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table for Phases 1-2 appear in both VERIFICATION.md and SUMMARY.md frontmatter files.

Phase 3 and Phase 4 requirements are not orphaned — they are correctly assigned in the traceability table — but their phases have not been started.
