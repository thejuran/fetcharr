## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Status | Score | Tests |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1. Foundation | Config, state, API clients, security invariants | PASSED | 12/12 | 21 |
| 2. Search Engine | Scheduler, round-robin, cycle logic | PASSED | 6/6 | 19 |
| 3. Web UI | Dashboard, config editor, htmx polling | PASSED | 10/10 | 12 |
| 4. Docker | Multi-stage Dockerfile, compose, entrypoint | PASSED | 6/6 | 5 |

All 4 phases passed verification with no critical gaps.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result:** 25/25 requirements WIRED across phases

Key cross-phase connections verified:
- Phase 1 → 2: ArrClient base, RadarrClient, SonarrClient consumed by search engine cycle functions
- Phase 1 → 3: Settings model, SecretStr API keys consumed by web routes (masked in UI)
- Phase 1 → 4: Startup orchestration invoked by Docker entrypoint
- Phase 2 → 3: run_radarr_cycle/run_sonarr_cycle called by Search Now handler; create_lifespan manages scheduler; make_search_job used for hot-reload
- Phase 2 → 4: State persistence survives container recreation via Docker volume
- Phase 3 → 4: Tailwind CSS compiled in Dockerfile builder stage; static files served from production image

**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0

## E2E Flows

All 8 end-to-end user flows verified complete:

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Container startup (entrypoint → startup → lifespan → scheduler → serve) | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Scheduled Radarr search cycle (fetch → filter → slice → search → log → persist) | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Scheduled Sonarr search cycle (fetch → filter → deduplicate → search → log → persist) | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Dashboard display (last run, next run, cursors, counts, connection status, search log) | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Settings editor (masked keys, TOML write, hot-reload scheduler/clients) | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Search Now button (immediate cycle, state save, htmx card swap) | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Connection failure/recovery display (unreachable since timestamp, green/red status) | COMPLETE |
| 8 | Docker deployment (compose up, volume persistence, PUID/PGID, healthcheck) | COMPLETE |

**Broken flows:** 0

---

## Anti-Patterns

No TODO/FIXME/HACK/placeholder anti-patterns found across any phase. One INFO-level note in Phase 1 verification (docstring in `__main__.py` mentioning "placeholder" describes intentional Phase 1 design — search loop was deferred to Phase 2 and subsequently implemented).

---

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All phases completed cleanly with no deferred items, warnings, or non-critical gaps.

---

## Human Verification Items

The following require live infrastructure testing (not achievable in static verification):

| Phase | Item | Risk |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Live connection validation with real *arr instances | Low |
| 1 | 401 Unauthorized error path with wrong API key | Low |
| 2 | First-run immediate search timing | Low |
| 2 | Cursor persistence across container restart | Low |
| 2 | Skip-and-continue on individual search failure | Low |
| 3 | Dashboard visual appearance in browser | Low |
| 3 | htmx 5s polling live behavior | Low |
| 3 | Settings save and hot-reload | Low |
| 3 | Search Now button live behavior | Low |
| 3 | API key masking round-trip | Low |
| 4 | Container boot and web UI reachability | Low |
| 4 | Volume persistence across recreation | Low |
| 4 | PUID/PGID file ownership | Low |

All items have low risk — automated code path coverage exists for each; live testing confirms runtime behavior.
