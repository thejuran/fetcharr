# v1.2 Milestone Audit: Polish & Harden

**Milestone Goal:** Harden search resilience, improve dashboard observability, and ship CI to GitHub.

**Audited:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** GAPS FOUND — 5/8 requirements unsatisfied (phases 14-16 not started)

---

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| 13 | CI & Search Diagnostics | Complete | PASSED (8/8 truths) |
| 14 | Dashboard Observability | Not started | No directory exists |
| 15 | Search History UI | Not started | No directory exists |
| 16 | Sonarr Episode Fallback | Not started | No directory exists |

**Phases completed:** 1/4

---

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| CICD-04 | CI workflow pushed to GitHub, tests pass on remote runners | 13 | SATISFIED | Listed (13-01) | [x] Complete | **SATISFIED** |
| SRCH-15 | Fetcharr detects Sonarr v3 vs v4 API version at startup | 13 | SATISFIED | Listed (13-02) | [x] Complete | **SATISFIED** |
| SRCH-16 | Fetcharr logs total item count fetched per cycle | 13 | SATISFIED | Listed (13-02) | [x] Complete | **SATISFIED** |
| WEBU-09 | Dashboard position labels show "X of Y" format | 14 | Missing | Missing | [ ] Pending | **UNSATISFIED** |
| WEBU-10 | Dashboard displays recent application log messages | 14 | Missing | Missing | [ ] Pending | **UNSATISFIED** |
| WEBU-11 | Search log entries show detail/outcome information | 14 | Missing | Missing | [ ] Pending | **UNSATISFIED** |
| SRCH-14 | Browse search history with filtering and pagination | 15 | Missing | Missing | [ ] Pending | **UNSATISFIED** |
| SRCH-17 | Sonarr episode fallback when SeasonSearch fails | 16 | Missing | Missing | [ ] Pending | **UNSATISFIED** |

**Score:** 3/8 requirements satisfied

### Orphaned Requirements

All 5 unsatisfied requirements are orphaned — present in the traceability table but absent from all phase VERIFICATION.md files because their assigned phases (14, 15, 16) have not been planned or executed.

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

Phase 13 is the only completed phase. Integration checker verified all internal wiring:

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| `sonarr.py:detect_api_version` | `startup.py:validate_connections` | Direct import + await call | WIRED |
| `engine.py` cycle counters | loguru | `logger.info` with consistent format | WIRED |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | `pyproject.toml` | `uv sync --extra dev` dependency resolution | WIRED |

**Score:** 3/3 connections verified — no orphaned exports, no missing connections within Phase 13.

### Forward-Looking Integration Gaps (Phase 14-16 Planning Notes)

These are not defects in Phase 13 — they are infrastructure that future phases must build:

1. **WEBU-11 requires schema migration** — `search_history` table has no `outcome` column; `insert_search_entry` signature and 4 call sites in `engine.py` must be updated
2. **WEBU-10 requires new log capture infrastructure** — no in-memory log buffer or loguru ring-buffer sink exists; Phase 14 must build from scratch
3. **SRCH-17 requires engine refactor** — `deduplicate_to_seasons` discards episode-level data; Phase 16 must restructure the season-search loop to retain episode access for fallback

---

## E2E Flows

All Phase 13 flows verified end-to-end:

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Sonarr version detection | `startup.py` → `sonarr.py:detect_api_version` → loguru INFO | COMPLETE |
| Radarr cycle diagnostics | `engine.py:run_radarr_cycle` → timing + counters → loguru INFO | COMPLETE |
| Sonarr cycle diagnostics | `engine.py:run_sonarr_cycle` → timing + counters → loguru INFO | COMPLETE |

**Score:** 3/3 flows complete

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 13 | CI must be pushed to GitHub to confirm remote runner execution | Low (local parity confirmed, 133 tests pass) |

**Total:** 1 item across 1 phase — no blockers, no anti-patterns found.

---

## Verdict

**Status: GAPS FOUND**

Phase 13 is solid — all 3 assigned requirements satisfied, all wiring verified, no anti-patterns. However, the milestone is only 1/4 complete with 5/8 requirements unsatisfied because phases 14, 15, and 16 have not been started.
