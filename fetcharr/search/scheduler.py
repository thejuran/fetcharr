"""APScheduler integration with FastAPI lifespan for automated search cycles.

Creates interval jobs for Radarr and Sonarr search cycles, managed through
FastAPI's lifespan context manager.  Shared state is exposed on ``app.state``
so that web routes can read it without coupling.  The ``make_search_job``
factory creates job closures that read from ``app.state`` rather than
capturing variables, enabling future hot-reload of clients and settings.
